QOL improvements for using the [Logitech G305](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g305-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-mouse.910-005280.html) wireless mouse on Linux

# Configuration

Use [Piper](https://github.com/libratbag/piper) to configure RGB, power mode (polling rate), DPI, buttons, etc...it's a one-stop shop!

# Monitoring

[Solaar](https://pwr-solaar.github.io/Solaar/) should be able to tell you general status AND battery level of the G305 but so far I have not been able to get it to work due to permission issues.
