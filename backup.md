A list of files and configurations that should be backed up to a secure location before installing a new environment (and removing the old one)

- [ ] SSH keys/profile
- [ ] Check all git repos are pushed to remote
  - [ ] Make backups of any `.env` and DB files in repos
- [ ] Gnome and Gnome extension configurations
- [ ] Monitors configuration (nvidia settings? xserver? wayland?)
- [ ] Bash Profile
